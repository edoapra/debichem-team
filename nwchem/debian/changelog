  [ Michael Banck ]
  * debian/patches/09_backported_6.1.1_fixes.patch: New patch, backports the
    source code changes of the nwchem-6.1.1 bugfix release (Closes: #695540):
    + PW: Fixed backspace issues on file I/O that caused I/O errors.
    + DFT: Removed dummy and bq centers from the Grimme dispersion
      corrections.
    + DFT: Fixed a race condition in the density fitting code.
    + DFT: Added a check for singularities in the HCTH functionals.
    + DFT: Fixed a problem with the DFT grids which caused strange behaviors
      if the number of cores is so large that some cores do not get any grid
      points.
    + HF&DFT: Fixed rolling back to distributed memory Fock-builder if not
      enough memory is available to use the replicated data one. Previously
      the code would crash trying to use non-existing GAs.
    + HF&DFT: Fixed clashes between MPI and GA communication when using OpenIB
      which enhances the stability.
    + MP2&DFT: On systems with limited I/O capabilities some quantities like
      2-electron integrals and DFT grids are now stored in memory rather than
      on disk.
    + CASSCF: Added ga_sync to fix race conditions that can cause the Davidson
      diagonalizer to fail.
    + CASSCF: Fixed a problem with the phase in the Lagrangian that caused
      problems with the gradient evaluation.
    + RAMAN: A number of problems with static polarizabilities were fixed.
    + Property: Fixed an issue with add_patch that caused unexpected results
      with dynamic polarizabilities.
    + DRDY: Removed system calls to copy files avoiding forking from NWChem
      processes which is relatively likely to fail due to the resources
      attached to such a process.
    + Input: Fixed some issues with GEOM LOAD that caused the selection of
      centers to fail in some cases.
    + Geometry: Dummy centers are no longer removed from a geometry so that
      constraints involving those centers remain valid.
    + Memory: All shared memory (global memory region) is now allocated at the
      start.
