Debian TODO for NWChem
======================

1. Replace NWChem internal blas/lapack code with linking to standard
refblas/lapack or ATLAS libraries.  Currently, the amd64 packages result in
testsuite failures due to crashes in ARMCI/Global Arrays (GA) for lapack calls
when linked against external linear algebra libraries.

2. Replace NWChem internal ARMCI/GA libraries with linking to
external (to be packaged) GA libraries.  For NWChem-6.5, GA-5.3 is used.

3. Reintroduce use of scalapack.  Building with scalapack and linking to the
libraries has been disabled in nwchem_6.1-1.

4. NWChem segfaults if no input file is given on the command line.
